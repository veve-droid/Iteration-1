# Iteration-1
Title: Repeat Until

Make a program for each of the following problems.

Observe the  following series: 4 8 7 14 12 16 21 28 20 24 35... Ask the user to enter a number n.  Then display the first n elements of the series.

Ask the user to enter a number, say n.  Determine if this number is a Germain Prime or not.  A number n is said to be Germain if it is prime and 2*n + 1 is also prime.  Samples: 5 is Germain because 5 is prime and so is 2*5+1 which is 11.  7 is not Germain, although it is prime, 2*7+1 is not prime.

Ask the user to enter two numbers. The first number represents a positive integer, say n, and the second a positive integer less than 10, say b. Convert n into its equivalent in base b.
